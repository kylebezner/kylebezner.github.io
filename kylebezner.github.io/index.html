<h1>Kyle Bezner</h1>
<p>I am currently a senior at Florida Gulf Coast University majoring in accounting. In addition to an array of clubs such as Beta Alpha Psi, Beta Gamma Sigma, Accounting Society, tutoring Financial Accounting, I have actively been involved in multiple internships.

  I have completed three internships in public accounting, and I have gained experience in both audit and tax service lines. During these internships, I utilized systems such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, CCH Engagement, and CaseWare to analyze and present companywide financial data..</p>
